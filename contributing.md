## Contributing
you can contribute in two ways:
### Reporting bugs and suggestions
if you find a bug, please be descriptive

report statistics such as your OS version, steps to reproduce the bug, and logs if possible

optionally provide a video or screenshot to help illustrate the bug.

if you have a suggestion, check the issues page first to see if it's already been suggested.

explain why you think this feature is useful or improving this project.

### Pull requests

fork the repository and create a new branch for your feature or bug fix.
commit your changes with a clear and concise commit message. (we don't want to read through your potentially horrible code)
create a PR with a clear title and description.

## Standards

### code
please keep your code light and avoid adding unnecessary features.

use camelCase and not any other naming conventions to keep the code consistent.

no importing of external libraries or frameworks if possible.

### assets

use SVG if possible over PNG

## code of conduct

don't be mean, don't pressure developers to implement your suggestions.

we have a life besides this project, so please keep it that way.
